## 📄 Bachelor Thesis
You can read the full documentation of the engineering process, including mathematical derivations, free body diagrams, and control theory:

* 🇩🇪 **[German Version (Original)](./thesis/Bachelor_Thesis_DE.pdf)**
* 🇬🇧 **[English Version (Translation)](./thesis/Bachelor_Thesis_EN.pdf)**

## 🎮 Simulation (Software-only Demo)
Since the hardware is custom-built, I have included a simulation environment to verify the control algorithms.

👉 **[Launch Simulation Folder](./MonowheelerControl/Sim/)** ### How to run:
1. Clone the repo: `git clone --recursive [URL]`
2. Go to: `cd MonowheelerControl/simulation`
3. Run: `python run_monowheeler_sim.py`
